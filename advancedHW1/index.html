         <p class='bio'> Well, where do I begin? Especially since I told most of my boring
             story on the other easier assignment. You know the big rule in coding. DRY!! Well,
             then again, I suppose only way to get better is repetition. All a programmers paradox!
             I get quite a kick out of these, especially when they occur in arenas of knowledge I have
             no business kicking up in, let along walking way from with surefire metaphoric 
             perspectives on life. 
                Reminds me of last Thanksgiving when I found myself sitting across was a sweet
                relatively laconic individual who eventually let it slip he was a phycisist with 
                12 years of specialized math/physics schooling under his belt. Forunately for him I was too tongue
                tied and anxious to get out any questions of coherence. Unfortuante for him, none of that
                stopped me from trying. I did manage to get one question out about his level of 
                cyncism towards the world knowing what he really knows about the universes truths.
                He adorably confessed only thing he really stays concerned about is his next round of calculations.
