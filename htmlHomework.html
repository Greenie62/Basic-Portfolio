    <div class='bio'><h3>About ME</h3>
    <p>Been in LA about 12 years...man I feel old to say that. Spent first decade being dillusional in pursuing screenwriting, but instead I just achieved a A-list level of anxiety.
        Fortunately, or not, got introduced to rock climbing and... just like a football team with a great safety,
        it covered alot of blemishes. Self-worth, as well as obsession could be satiated while I fooled myself on 
        'being a writer', worth noting I did finish my one story, and the one person I allowed to read it liked it.
        I retired on top. LOL. But through that, I had somehow stumbled into the world of entropy, 
        quantum mechanics and Shrodingers equation on the wave function. Not that I understood ANY of the math
        behind it, I was just endlessly fascinated by it. This, 'naturally', led me to knock on the door of theoritical computer science, 
        the world of P vs NP and the book of Quantum computing since Democritus. Id say it was like reading 
        a Chinese phonebook but since thats one of their Turing thought experiments, even there I feel Im a maverick
        on esoteric ground. So finally, after conceding to string theory and P vs NP I realized that just computer programming at a regular level,
        THAT might be something a bit more in the relm on reasonable. However a bootcamp from that brainstorm was way
        to daunting, I knew Id be chewed up n spit out no matter how hard I tried and so, Ive given myself a comfortable 1.5
        year headstart and have found that indeed, I enjoy the computers 'thought process'. As one who has horrible bouts of neurotic anxiety/over-thought, Ive
        found reassurance to how I function compared to the computer. Easiet example, a function needing a argument to execute. Im bladder shy, if you dont put 'quiet,alone' in as a a parameter. Me and my bladder are just gonna stand there waiting.
        I had a friend in prison and told her, they would have killed me on random piss tests. LOL. So on that random perhaps overly personal note,
        let me finish and say Im really excited to be in this program. Learning on my own has been nice but just no way around it
        Im not a natural and I need a kick in the ass. A kick in the ass 1.5 yrs ago would have just overflustered me, now 
        it should only just fluster! haha
