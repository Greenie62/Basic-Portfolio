        <p> I moved out to LA about 12 years ago. I worked in nightclubs for 8 years and got a mildly 
            ridiculous screenplay out of it, but, wasnt interested in what it took to go past that. Over
            the time I found climbing and haphazardly fell in love with theoretical physics and computer science
            which, endlessly fascinating but...I was about 20 yrs too late for seriously committing to that esoteric course.
            However computer programming seemed like a nice middle ground compromise. So here I am.
